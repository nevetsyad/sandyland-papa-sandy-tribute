## ⚙️ **Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages**

1. **Go to** your repository on GitHub
2. **Click** "Settings" tab
3. **Scroll down** to "Pages" section
4. **Source**: Choose "Deploy from a branch"
5. **Branch**: Select "main" (or "master")
6. **Folder**: "/ (root)"
7. **Click** "Save"

## 🌐 **Step 4: Access Your Game**

Your Sandyland game will be available at:
```
https://your-github-username.github.io/
```

**Note**: It may take 1-5 minutes for GitHub Pages to deploy your site.

## ✅ **Step 5: Run Deployment Verification (Required)**

After each deploy:
1. Copy the deployed URL from the GitHub Actions deploy job output.
2. Open that URL and verify console sanity (no blocking runtime errors).
3. Run gameplay smoke checks and record results.
4. If checks fail, perform a revert-based rollback and redeploy.
