# Archive (Non-Deployment Files)

These files are kept for reference/debug history and are **not part of the release runtime**.

## Canonical release runtime
- `../index.html` → loads `../simple-game.js`

## Archived here
- Old/backup entry pages (`index-backup.html`, `simple-index.html`, `minimal-index.html`, `game.html`)
- Test harnesses (`test-game.html`, `test-debug.html`, `test-syntax.js`)
- Backup engine snapshot (`simple-game-backup.js`)

If you are preparing a release, ignore this folder except for historical comparison.
